## Project Description

The Interactive Step Component is a React-project designed to provide users with an interactive, multi-step guide for achieving specific tasks or goals. This application allows users to navigate through a series of predefined messages presented as steps, guiding them through a process while providing the flexibility to move forward or backward in the sequence.

### Key Features:

- **Step Navigation:** Users can move between different steps using "Previous" and "Next" buttons, facilitating a step-by-step progression through the guide.
- **Dynamic Messaging:** Each step presents a unique message relevant to the task or goal, offering clear instructions or information for the user.
- **Visual Indicators:** The active step is highlighted visually, providing users with a clear indication of their current position within the guide.
- **Flexible Interaction:** The application includes a close button to hide the steps/messages section, giving users the option to focus on the main content or return to the guide later.
- **State Management:** Utilizes React's useState hook to manage the state variables responsible for tracking the current step and controlling the visibility of the steps/messages section.
